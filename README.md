ghetto-console
==============
by Hunter Bridges

A half-baked console solution for decrepit browsers.
Just drop ghetto-console.js and console.log your heart away.
It appears after your first console.log

Design Decisions
================

* Compact
* Zero configuration
* Mindless to use
* Out of the way, there when you need it

Potential futures for this project
==================================

* Not depending on jQuery
* Support for additional log types (Like console.error... but who uses that?)

Contributions welcome.

Long live IE6
